OntoBrowser
---
The OntoBrowser tool was developed to manage ontologies (and controlled terminologies e.g. [CDISC SEND](http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CDISC/SEND/SEND%20Terminology.html)). The primary goal of the tool is to provide an online collaborative solution for expert curators to map code list terms (sourced from multiple systems/databases) to preferred ontology terms. Other key features include visualisation of ontologies in hierarchical/graph format, advanced search capabilities, peer review/approval workflow and web service access to data. 

# Key Features
* Web based collaborative ontology curation
* Interactive hierarchical/graph visualisation
* Cross ontology searching
* Synonym mapping
* Automated mapping of similar matching synonyms 
* Central database for all ontologies
* Version tracking
* Review/Approve workflow
* Email notification
* Full curator audit trail/history

#Acknowledgements
The OntoBrowser was initially developed in frame of the eTOX consortium. It has received support from the Innovative Medicines Initiative Joint Undertaking under grant agreement n°115002, resources of which are composed of financial contribution from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) and EFPIA companies' in kind contribution. We would like to formally acknowledge the contribution to the eTOX project of all scientists and other staff involved.
