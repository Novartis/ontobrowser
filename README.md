OntoBrowser
---
The OntoBrowser tool was developed to manage ontologies (and controlled terminologies e.g. [CDISC SEND](http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CDISC/SEND/SEND%20Terminology.html)). The primary goal of the tool is to provide an online collaborative solution for expert curators to map code list terms (sourced from multiple systems/databases) to preferred ontology terms. Other key features include visualisation of ontologies in hierarchical/graph format, advanced search capabilities, peer review/approval workflow and web service access to data. 

# Key Features
* Web based collaborative ontology curation
* Interactive hierarchical/graph visualisation
* Cross ontology searching
* Synonym mapping
* Automated mapping of similar matching synonyms 
* Central database for all ontologies
* Version tracking
* Review/Approve workflow
* Email notification
* Full curator audit trail/history

# Documentation

* [Web Services](doc/web_services.md)
* [Database Design](doc/database_design.pdf)
* [Security Review](doc/security_review.md)
